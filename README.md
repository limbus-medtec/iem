# IEM Configuration
This repository contains configuration files for the Illumina(R) Experiment Manager (IEM) for third-party indices. Adding these files to your IEM configuration will allow you to create SampleSheets using IEM for third-party library kits.

## Installation

IEM is typically installed into a directory such as this:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Illumina\Illumina Experiment Manager
```

The IEM program directory contains four directories:

```
Applications
Genomes
IndexKits
SamplePrepKits
```

Copy the files from the directories in this repository into the respective directory of IEM on your computer. Then, restart IEM.
