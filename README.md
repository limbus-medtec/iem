# IEM Configuration
This repository contains configuration files for the Illumina速 Experiment Manager (IEM) for third-party indices. 
Adding these files to your IEM configuration will allow you to create SampleSheets using IEM for third-party library kits.

The configuration files were created for use with IEM 1.19.1 following the instructions in the 
[IEM Software Guide](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/software_documentation/iem/illumina-experiment-manager-software-guide-15031335-09.pdf) 
from January 2021.

The files are provided as a courtesy to users of the [varvis速 software](https://www.varvis.com). 
They are free to use for anybody else. Feedback or feature requests are always welcome.
